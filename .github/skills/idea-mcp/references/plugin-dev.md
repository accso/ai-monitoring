# Plugin & Monorepo DevKit

Narrow, specialist toolsets for IntelliJ Platform plugin development and the JetBrains monorepo. Only relevant when the project under work is itself a JetBrains/IntelliJ plugin or the platform monorepo — not for ordinary application code.

## Toolsets covered
- **DevKit MCP toolset** - plugin-development helpers: locating/analyzing extension points, plugin.xml structure, platform API usage, read/write-lock and UI-thread ("EDT") requirement analysis for a method under the cursor.
- **Monorepo DevKit MCP toolset** - navigation and analysis helpers scoped for the scale of the JetBrains platform monorepo (many modules across the codebase).

## Activation Gate (tool availability and project applicability)
Use this guidance only when **both** conditions hold:
1. At least one DevKit tool is available in the current MCP session (e.g. `analyze_threading_requirements`/`analyze_calls`, or another `devkit_*`/`monorepo_*`-named tool exposed by the live schema — verify the exact name live, see note below).
2. The project under work is confirmed to actually be an IntelliJ-platform plugin or the JetBrains monorepo (look for `plugin.xml`, a dependency on `intellij-platform`/`intellij.platform.*` artifacts, or the repo being the JetBrains monorepo).

If either condition fails, state the blocker explicitly and fall back to `references/explore.md`/`references/edit.md` instead — DevKit tools produce heuristic, sometimes unreliable results outside a genuine plugin/platform project, and calling them elsewhere wastes a round trip.

**Naming caveat (confirmed live 2026-08-13):** this session's live MCP schema (bare names, no `idea_` prefix) exposed a tool named `analyze_calls`, not `analyze_threading_requirements` as this file previously documented. Whether `analyze_calls` is the renamed/current form of the same UI-thread/lock-analysis tool, or a different tool entirely (e.g. a general call-graph tool unrelated to DevKit), was **not verified** — its description was not inspected in this session. Before relying on it for threading/lock analysis, check its live tool schema description/parameters to confirm it actually does what this file describes; do not assume the name mapping below is correct.

## Tool reference

| Situation | Tool | Key parameters |
|---|---|---|
| Analyze UI-thread ("EDT") / read-write-lock requirements for the method under the caret, with call paths | `analyze_threading_requirements` (name **unconfirmed** in this session's live schema — closest live match was `analyze_calls`; verify before use, see caveat above) | `filePath`, `line`, `column` (all required, 1-based, identify the method under the caret), `projectPath?` |
| Locate/analyze extension point usages, plugin.xml structure | not consistently documented publicly — check the live MCP tool list for names prefixed `devkit_*` (no `idea_` prefix in this session's schema); typical parameters follow the same `filePath`+`line`+`column` or `projectPath`-only pattern as other tools in this session |
| Monorepo-scale navigation/analysis helpers | not consistently documented publicly — check the live MCP tool list for `monorepo_*`-style names; expect `projectPath?` plus a query/glob-style filter parameter |

Exact DevKit/Monorepo DevKit tool names and parameters are less consistently documented publicly than the core toolsets — always confirm the current name and full parameter list against the live tool schema exposed by your MCP client before calling, rather than assuming the names above are exhaustive.

The UI-thread/lock/call-path analysis tool (whatever its confirmed live name is) returns **heuristic** results: call paths may be unreachable in practice and coverage may be incomplete. Treat its output as a lead to investigate, not a proven fact — confirm suspicious findings by reading the actual code (`references/explore.md`) or, if runtime confirmation is needed, via `references/debugger.md`.

## Workflow
1. **Confirm applicability first.** Re-check the Activation Gate above before calling anything in this reference.
2. **Treat call-path/lock/thread analysis as heuristic.** Use it to narrow investigation, then confirm with a real read or a debugger session — never assert a threading violation from this tool's output alone.
3. **Position precisely.** These tools operate on "the method under the caret" via `filePath` + 1-based `line`/`column` — get exact coordinates from a prior search/read (`references/explore.md`) before calling.
4. **Combine with general toolsets.** DevKit findings (e.g. a UI-thread requirement) typically inform an edit or refactor — hand off to `references/edit.md` once you know what to change.

## Argument hygiene
- `line`/`column` are 1-based and must come from a prior `references/explore.md` result, never guessed.
- Pass `projectPath` when known, especially in monorepo sessions where multiple modules/projects may be open simultaneously.
- Do not fabricate placeholder values for optional parameters; omit them instead.

## When NOT to use this guidance
- Ordinary application/service code with no plugin/platform dependency -> `references/explore.md` / `references/edit.md`.
- Verifying actual runtime thread/lock violations rather than static heuristic candidates -> `references/debugger.md`.
